# hate_speech_detector

## Data

We are currently working with the data collected by Davidson et al. for their research on hate speech detection. The dataset contains tweets that are labeled as either hate speech, offensive language, or neither. The data were pulled from Hatebase.org, an organization that collects instances of potential hate speech. The data were then labeled using CrowdFlower which uses non-specialists to clean and label data. Each tweet was reviewed by three or more people and a majority-wins approach was taken when there way disagreement.

All data used in this analysis is stored in the data folder of this repository. The original source of the data is :https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language
